# HA-AWCC-Data-Analyzer
This is a Windows application to analyze coincidence counting data from the HA-AWCC

To analyze HA-AWCC data, copy entire "hawcc_app" directory into your Windows machine's C: directory. The name and location of the directories matter! To run the full analysis, launch the application and click "Analyze Data Folder." Select the folder of data you wish to analyze (this folder should be in the ha_awcc\hawcc_data directory). Note that the data folder must have a particular structure and files require specific names. The data folder must contain folders called "inner", "outer", and "sum". These folders must contain .RTS or .VER files from INCC.

System parameters can be read in using saved files (examples attached).
